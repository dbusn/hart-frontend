  <h1>How to get started</h1>
  <p>In the tab for phonemes, you can do everything related to phonemes! This includes viewing all the phonemes that are
    used, just training single phonemes, but also taking a test. In the tab 'Words', you can do similar stuff as in the
    phonemes tab, but then with words. In the 'Audio' tab, you can upload an audio file for processing.</p>
